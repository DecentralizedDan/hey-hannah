# Long-Running Process Confirmation Rule

Always ask for explicit user confirmation before starting any process that could take a long time (more than 30 seconds) or consume significant resources.

## Processes That Require Confirmation

- **Expo Development Builds**: `eas build` commands (can take up to 4 hours)
- **Package Installation**: Large package installs or updates
- **File Generation**: Creating multiple files or large files
- **Build Processes**: Any compilation or build commands
- **Network Operations**: Large downloads, uploads, or API calls
- **Database Operations**: Migrations, large data operations
- **CI/CD Triggers**: Deployment or automated build triggers

## Confirmation Format

Before executing any long-running command, ask:

```
This process may take [estimated time] and will [brief description of what it does].
Do you want to proceed? (y/n)
```

## Examples

**Good:**

- "This will create an Expo development build which can take up to 4 hours. Do you want to proceed?"
- "Installing these dependencies may take 2-3 minutes. Should I continue?"

**Bad:**

- Starting `eas build` without warning about time
- Running long npm installs without confirmation
- Triggering deployments without user awareness

## Exceptions

- Quick operations under 30 seconds don't need confirmation
- File reads, small edits, or simple commands
- Operations explicitly requested by the user with full context
