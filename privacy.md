Effective Date: September 1st, 2025  
Version: 1.0

## 1. Overview

Hey Hannah does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. The application functions entirely on-device. The only data we receive comes from the aggregated, anonymized analytics and crash information that Apple provides through App Store Connect.

## 2. Data We Do **Not** Collect

- No account creation or login
- No name, email address, phone number, or contact list
- No precise location data
- No usage tracking beyond Apple-supplied analytics
- No advertising identifiers
- No user-generated content or text

## 3. Data We Access Locally

The app may request the following device permissions:

- **Photo Library Access** – Permission to save text images to your photo library when you choose to save them. We do not read, access, or transmit any existing photos.
- **Clipboard Access** – Permission to copy generated images to your device clipboard when you choose to copy them.

All data accessed through these permissions remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.

## 4. Analytics and Diagnostics

Apple provides us with aggregated statistics _(including download counts, crash logs, and generic usage metrics)_. These reports contain **no user-identifiable information**. We use this data solely to improve app stability and performance.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Hey Hannah is designed to be safe for users of all ages. The app:

- Collects no personal information
- Requires no account creation
- Processes all data locally on the device
- Complies with COPPA requirements for children under 13

## 6. Data Security

All text processing and image generation occurs locally on your device. Since we operate no servers and collect no personal data, there is no risk of data breaches involving your personal information. Apple handles security for any anonymized analytics data before we receive it.
