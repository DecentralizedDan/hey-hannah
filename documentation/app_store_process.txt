## How to Build and Upload to the App Store

### Step 1: Increment Version and Build Numbers
Before building for App Store submission, ensure version and build numbers are properly updated:
- Update app version in `app.json` if this is a new release (e.g., 1.1.0 → 1.2.0)
- Increment build number in `app.json` (e.g., "5" → "6")
- Build numbers must always increase and never reset
- Each App Store submission requires a unique, higher build number

### Step 2: Select Build Target
In Xcode:
- Select "Generic iOS Device" as the build target from the device/simulator dropdown

### Step 3: Archive the Build
In Xcode:
- Go to "Product" menu
- Select "Archive"
- Wait for the archive process to complete

### Step 4: Distribute to App Store
After archiving:
- Select the archive from the organizer window
- Click "Distribute App"
- Choose "App Store Connect" as the distribution method
- Follow the prompts to upload to App Store Connect

### Step 5: Upload New Screenshots
If necessary:
- Generate new Screenshots
- Download and compress them as follows:
$     mogrify -quality 75% *.jpg
or, to limit the images to 500KB
$     mogrify -define jpeg:extent=500KB *.jpg
or, to create the compressed images in a different directory:
$     mogrify -path ../compressed_images -define jpeg:extent=500KB *.jpg
